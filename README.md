Useful functions for modelling

### Installation

surveytoolbox is not released on CRAN (yet). 
You can install the latest development version from GitHub with:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("martinctc/modeltoolbox")
```
---
This package is currently still under development, so it does come with a health advice: if you do wish to use them - have a check and run through the examples before assimilating them into your analysis.
